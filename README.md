# Pocket Mine
https://ryosaku610.github.io/Pocket-mine/
Pocket Mine is a hackathon demo app for airport lithium battery screening. It turns one battery photo or one label reading into a clear operational decision:

- `CLEAR TO FLY`
- `NEEDS HUMAN CHECK`
- `DO NOT BOARD`

The pitch concept is:

```text
Scan the pocket. Find the mine. Save the flight.
```

The local demo runs without API keys. It uses deterministic mock analysis so the pitch can be presented anywhere, while the UI and data model are shaped for a real Google stack.

The current UI includes two extra pitch modules:

- `Can it fly?`: an instant search panel for `Wh`, visible appearance, spare-battery status, and carry-on / checked-bag handling.
- `Danger Battery Atlas`: a field-learning view where detected cases become staff education patterns and a simulated AI precision signal.

## Google Stack Concept

- Gemini: multimodal reasoning over battery image, shape, label context, and visible damage.
- Cloud Vision OCR: extraction of `mAh`, `Wh`, voltage, and warning labels.
- Vertex AI: managed model deployment, evaluation, and safety policy versioning.
- Cloud Run: low-latency inspection API for airport tablets and kiosks.
- Firebase: authentication, offline-first inspection records, and audit trail sync.
- BigQuery: incident trend analysis and airport safety reporting.

The browser app has an optional integration point: set `window.POCKET_MINE_GOOGLE_ENDPOINT` before `src/app.js` loads, and the scan flow will POST `{ image, labelText, prompt }` to that endpoint. If the endpoint fails or is absent, the app falls back to the built-in demo rules.

## Demo Rules

The demo follows common passenger lithium battery screening thresholds:

- Visible swelling, heat marks, leakage, or terminal damage: `isolate`
- Capacity unreadable: `review`
- `<= 100Wh` with no damage signs: `carry`
- `> 100Wh` and `<= 160Wh`: `review`
- `> 160Wh`: `isolate`

This is a pitch prototype, not an operational safety authority. Real deployment must be validated against the airport, airline, and regulator policy in force on the deployment date.

## Run

Node.js 20 or newer is required.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

Change the port if needed:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

## Use

1. Select one of the demo batteries, or upload a battery image.
2. Edit the OCR / label candidate text if needed.
3. Press `Start Scan`.
4. Watch the camera overlay move through shape, label, swelling, Wh, and damage checks.
5. Read the single final decision and the five evidence factors.
6. Use `Can it fly?` to test capacity, appearance, spare battery, and bag placement instantly.
7. Show `Danger Battery Atlas` to explain how detections become education data.
8. Export JSON or copy a briefing for pitch notes.

The UI also includes the generated `Pocket Mine Inspector` mascot at `src/assets/pocket-mine-mascot.png`.

## Test

```bash
npm run check
```

The checks cover syntax and the core analyzer:

- `mAh` + voltage to `Wh` conversion
- explicit `Wh` parsing
- carry / review / isolate classification
- missing label review behavior
- uploaded-image damage hint detection
- `Can it fly?` capacity / appearance / spare-battery behavior
- Gemini prompt contract

## Files

- `src/app.js`: UI, demo flow, camera/upload handling, optional Google endpoint call.
- `src/analyzer.js`: testable label parser, capacity conversion, risk rules, demo data, Gemini prompt builder.
- `src/export.js`: JSON and text report downloads.
- `test/analyzer.test.js`: Node test suite for the decision engine.
